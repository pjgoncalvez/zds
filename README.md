This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# ðŸš§ This is still in its early stages ðŸš§
The rationale behind this side-project is to practice my react skills and also go through some of the problems of implementing a design system.

The main goals are:
  - âœ…  Configure a storybook with the built
  - âœ…  Add storybook controls for all component stories (include accessibility tests tab)
  - âœ…  Add storybook-cypress plug-in so cypress tests can interact with the storybook controls on the fly
  - âœ…  Add visual tests for all stories
  - ðŸš§  Add unit tests for all the components
  - ðŸš§  Slowly but steady increase the number of components on the lib
  - ðŸš§  Add more color themes


### This is my take on implementing a design system from design specs.
